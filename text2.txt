The sky is a dull gray, as if there’s no end in sight. Walking down the empty streets, my steps feel heavy, as if I’m trudging through mud, unable to break free. The noise around me seems irrelevant, leaving only an endless sense of loneliness and confusion in my heart. All the efforts I’ve made seem to have turned into bubbles, vanishing into thin air. Where does the future lead? No one can tell. Life feels like an endless marathon, exhausting, yet there’s no reason to stop. Perhaps this is fate—destined to struggle alone in the darkness.
